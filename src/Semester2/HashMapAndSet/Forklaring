HASHMAP:
________________________________________________________________________________________
ArrayList store items as an ordered collection, has access with index number (int type).
HashMap uses key/value pairs, which can be accessed by an index of another type.
Example: Key/value as int/String or String/String or int/int.

One object is used as a key (index) to another object (value).
It can store different types: String keys and Integer values,
or the same type, like: String keys and String Values.

The capitalCities class uses String/String as example: "England"/"London".
The PersonAndAge class uses String/Integer as example: "SÃ¸ren"/36

Different between Map and Set:
________________________________________________________________________________________
ADDING: Map uses "put" for adding items while Set uses "add" as ArrayList.
FINDING ONE ITEM: Map uses "get" for finding one item while Set uses "contains"

Common stuffs for both Map and Set.

Note: HashMap and HashSet can ONLY have unique Keys. Values can be the same.
"England"/"London"
"England"/"Lond"
This will ONLY saves the last one, which overwrote the first one.
